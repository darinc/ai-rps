========= Round 1:
Since there is no move history, I will start with 'rock,' as it's a solid, aggressive choice and many people begin with it.

========= Round 2:
The opponent played 'paper' last round and they might stick with it or switch to 'scissors'. To cover these possibilities, I will play 'scissors', which wins against paper and ties with scissors.

========= Round 3:
The opponent has played 'paper' followed by 'rock'. Assuming they might cycle through the options, they might choose 'scissors' next. To counter this, I will choose 'rock'.

========= Round 4:
The opponent's previous moves were 'paper' and 'rock'. If they're cycling through choices, 'scissors' might be next. However, if they are reacting to my moves, it's safer to counter their last move which was 'rock'. Therefore, I'll play 'paper' to potentially counter either a repeat 'rock' or a 'scissors'.

========= Round 5:
The opponent's move history shows 'paper' followed by 'rock'. It's possible they will follow a cycle by going for 'scissors' next, as players sometimes follow patterns. Therefore, choosing 'rock' might be a strategic move to win.

========= Round 6:
The opponent has played each move once. To maximize my chances, I'll choose 'rock' because it beats both the potentially repeated 'scissors' and creates a tie with 'rock' again.

========= Round 7:
Claude Sonnet 3.5 has a tendency to avoid repeating a previous move, possibly anticipating a counter. Analyzing the pattern, the most recent move is 'paper', following a complete cycle of rock-paper-scissors. To stay one step ahead, choosing 'scissors' would counter the neutral stance if they repeat 'paper', and is also a fair bet if they arbitrarily choose without following strict repetition.

========= Round 8:
Analyzing the pattern of the opponent's moves, 'paper', 'rock', 'scissors', it repeats in the same sequence. If this pattern continues, the next move should be 'paper'. Therefore, I will choose 'scissors' to defeat 'paper'.

========= Round 9:
The opponent has played 'paper', 'rock', 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock'. It seems they might be following a pattern. The last two moves were 'paper' and 'rock', which could suggest 'scissors' if they are cycling through their moves. Therefore, playing 'rock' could win or at least tie.

========= Round 10:
Analyzing the pattern of my opponent's moves, they've chosen 'rock' twice in their last five moves, and just played 'rock.' They might switch to the next in sequence or counter their last move, possibly choosing 'paper'. My best counter to that would be to play 'scissors.'
